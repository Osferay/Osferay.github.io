Since February 2024, I have been a Research Assistant at the Institut für Analysis und Algebra at the Technische Universität Braunschweig for the project "Das Konjugiertheitsproblem und Gruppen von Automorphismen" founded by the DFG. Previously, I completed my master's degree at the University of the Basque Country, where I wrote my master's thesis under the supervision of Ilya Kazachkov about Parafree Residually Free groups. It is available [here](https://academica-e.unavarra.es/bitstream/handle/2454/44407/TFM.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
