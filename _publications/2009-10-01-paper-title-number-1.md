title: "The conjugacy problem and canonical representatives in finitely generated nilpotent groups"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'We describe algorithms that determine a canonical representative of a conjugacy class of elements, lists and subgroups in finitely generated nilpotent groups. The algorithms thus solve the associated conjugacy problems. They additionally compute the corresponding centralizers or normalizers, respectively.'
