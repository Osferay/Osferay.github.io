title: "On the class-breadth conjecture for algebras and T-groups"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'We describe an algorithm to compute the breadth of an algebra given by structure constants and show how this can be used to compute the breadth of a finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent group. We give a new proof that the class-breadth conjecture holds in finite-dimensional nilpotent algebras over infinite fields and in finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent groups.'
